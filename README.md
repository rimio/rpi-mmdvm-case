# Raspberry Pi 3B+ / MMDVM case

This is a 3D printable case with active cooling support for a Raspberry Pi 3B+ (and compatible) and a MMDVM HAT.

You need to print the case and lid STLs once and the post STL twice. Default PrusaSlicer settings worked fine for me.

This project requires the following additional hardware:
* 8 low profile 3mm threaded inserts
* 4 M3x?? hex screws
* 4 M3x?? hex screws
* a 30x30x10mm cooler fan
