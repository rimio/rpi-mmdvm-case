# Raspberry Pi 3B+ / MMDVM case

This is a 3D printable case with active cooling support for a Raspberry Pi 3B+ (and compatible) and a MMDVM HAT.

You need to print the case and lid STLs once and the post STL twice. Default PrusaSlicer settings worked fine for me.

This project requires the following additional hardware:
* 4 low profile 2.5mm (or 3mm, see note below) threaded inserts
* 4 M2.5x25 (or M3x25, see note below) countersunk hex head screws
* 4 low profile 3mm threaded inserts
* 4 M3x12 hex head screws
* a 30x30x10mm cooler fan

*NOTE: If using the more common M3 screws and inserts for the case then you'll have to slightly enlarge the Raspberry Pi and MMDVM PCB mounting holes by delicately running an M3 drillbit through them. This will not damage your boards if done properly.*
